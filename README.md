- How to run the algorithms
    - algorithms are organized in folders by type
    - file name is hardcoded as "filename" in each .py file, only the number for each test case needs to be changed
    - all_greedy.py is used as a testing file and can be ignored, use the individual greedy_weight.py, greedy_value.py, and greedy_ratio.py files
    - if using VS Code, you can use the play button in the top right
